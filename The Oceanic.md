# The Oceanic
An Aquatic slugcat built for survivability and the depths below.

___

## Overview
The Oceanic lives in the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and in the vast lands above. It ventures onto land frequently, for food diversity. Fast and nimble, It cuts through the sunlit waters. Where life crawls and spires fall, the Oceanic drifts through the ruins of it all.

## Biology

**Habitat:**

The Oceanic resides in the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and in the vast lands above. Although built for the seas, it ventures onto land frequently, primarily because the land provides more food density and diversity.

**Appearance:**

Its skin is colored in a gradient of teals and deep navies, tapering into a pale cream underside. Spots of bioluminescence are scattered along its back down to its tail. These patterns help it communicate, distract predators, and slightly illuminate its path through dark waters (though this comes at the risk of making it visible to predators).

The Oceanic has four eyes, granting amazing vision in both darkness and water. Its gills, located on the sides of the head, are deep lavender and can rarely shift to a pink or blue depending on the situation. Webbed feet and a tail with fin-like webbing on both sides provide lift and agility in swimming. On each hand, a venomous spur can deliver a potent hallucinogenic toxin that incapacitates attackers.

**Diet:**

Its diet includes: Small fish, underwater plant life, and rarely larger aquatic life.
Food options are quite limited underwater, since food options are sparse and hunting can be quite dangerous in some cases. For this reason, the Oceanic usually forages/hunts for food on land. 
On the surface, its diet usually includes: Fruit, popcorn plant, batflies, basically anything they can get their hands on. The Oceanic is omnivorous.

**Reproduction:**

The Oceanic reproduces asexually via budding. When they start the process, a bud starts to form on the top side of the tail. In ~1-2 cycles, the bud detaches and rapidly starts to internally separate, developing a juvenile inside. This egg has faint bioluminescence under the blue outer membrane, causing it to glow slightly in some areas. This glowing helps the parent locate the egg, and indicating that it's still healthy. Within ~2-3 cycles, the Oceanic slugpup emerges.

After the egg hatches safely, the Oceanic then promptly leaves the slugpup on it's own to mature. For the first few cycles, the slugpup consumes microscopic plankton and algae, and keeping far away from any danger. Once plankton and algae are not sustainable, or does not give enough sustenance, the juvenile will learn to kill and or forage for better food.

**Behavior:**

The Oceanic is not a very social creature, especially compared to other slugcats. This is probably because of their lack of parental care, which reduces the need for social interaction.

## Physiology

**Bioluminescence:**

The Oceanic’s bioluminescence is produced by a light emitting molecule called **Mariluciferin**, which is activated by the enzyme **Cerulophotoxidase**.

	Mariluciferin + O2 --[Cerulophotoxidase + Ca2]--> Light + Oxidized Mariluciferin
	Oxidized Mariluciferin + ATP --[Mariphotoreductase]--> Mariluciferin

When the Oceanic sends oxygen to **Cerulophotoxidase**, **Mariluciferin** oxidizes, producing a soft teal and navy glow. Specialized photocyte cells produce **Mariphotoreductase**, rapidly restoring **oxidized Mariluciferin** to its active form, allowing perpetual illumination without depleting chemical reserves.

**Venom Spur:**

The Oceanic can also deliver a strong venom called **Thalasocyanin** through a spur located on each hand. **Thalasocyanin** consists of a small lipophilic molecule that triggers extremely vivid hallucinations and a disulfide rich neuropeptide that temporarily paralyzes muscles and dilates blood vessels. The venom is stored as protective granules in paired subdermal glands and released via muscle contractions during pressure on the spur.

	Venom Injected
       ↓
	Lipophilic compound > Hallucinations
	Neuropeptide > Paralysis & Vasodilation
       ↓
	Metabolism & clearance
Upon injection, the two compounds begin acting almost immediately. The lipophilic compound induces hallucinations within the first second. After roughly five seconds, muscle paralysis begins in the injected limb, progressing to full-body paralysis by around eight seconds.

**Respiration:**

The Oceanic’s respiratory system consists of two pairs of **gill filaments** and **internal lungs**, which switch priority depending on the environment.

When underwater, the Oceanic uses it's gills. They are covered in small blood vessels, which when submerged, extract oxygen from the water and dispose of carbon dioxide. Their structure is similar to that of its sister species (The Rivulet), but the Oceanic’s gills are far more efficient, allowing it to stay submerged indefinitely.

On land, the internal lungs are used instead of the gills. These lungs draw in air, extracting the oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide and other byproducts. The lungs extract oxygen efficiently, allowing the Oceanic to spend time on land indefinitely. The lungs can also be used as a swim bladder, inflating and deflating with oxygen to float or sink. This is also whats used to keep the Oceanic neutrally buoyant when underwater.

Air extraction:

	Water --> Gills --[O2]--> Blood --> Body
	Air --> Lungs --[O2]--> Blood --> Body
	
	Lungs Underwater:
	Gills --[O2]--> Lungs inflate
	
	This is kind of a useless diagram, I don't know what else to add...

## Lore
> NOTE: The lore section is VERY unfinished, so things may be subject to completely being changed. Thanks!

**Pre-Campaign:** Timeline

The Oceanic's story begins in between **Rivulet** and **Saints** campaign, where the rain has caused a vast ocean to form. Around this time, Five Pebbles and the Rot are at their peak output which produced *vast* amounts of water, more then could be cycled back into the superstructure. Other factors also caused more water to collect away from iterators. For example: other iterators started failing that where near the retaining wall of LTTM and FP. These events cause the creation of **The Basin**. The Oceanic starts some time after these events, when FP has collapsed and the rain is near normal amounts (Survivor Timeline).

ASCII Timeline because I can:

	Spearmaster     Artificer     Hunter     Gourmand     Survivor&Monk     Rivulet     Oceanic     Saint
	     |  	    	|            |          |               |              |           |          |
	     +--------------+------------+----------+---------------+--------------+-----------+----------+
	     
	PS: This looks very bad when not in a markdown viewer!


*Most* of the iterator super structures that could be accessed from the Basion within a reasonable amount of time are all collapsed. There is one superstructure that lasted, but I'll keep their name hidden for now.

**Pre-Campaign:** Slugpup

Since the Oceanic's species reproduces asexually, *our* Oceanic is not much different. I *could* write a very descriptive timeline on how much plankton and algae they ate, but I feel like that wouldn't be interesting. Instead, I'm just going to say that they ate enough plankton and algae (like any good slugpup should) and didn't die.
"They ate enough plankton and algae and didn't die."

**The Campaign:** Part 1

We find ourselves lost in an underwater ruin of some sorts. Starting from an air pocket, the player can venture through many winding tunnels and tubes, and small openings that scatter light into the water. The player will be able use the Oceanic's absurd lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as they want, as they try to figure out what they are in. The faint glow that's given off of the slugcat also aids in finding their way.

Eventually, with some time the player will be able to see more light. Following the light will lead to a new room, with stronger light. Another room with more light leads to the exit, where the player finds themselves in a vast coral reef. Small fish swim by above. Here, the player can get food and sleep in the nearby shelter, which is hidden behind a growth of kelp.
