## Overview
Adapted for the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and the vast land above, the Oceanic is unlike any see before. Fast and nimble, it cuts through the sunlit waters and maneuvers across the dense surface. Where life crawls and spires fall, the Oceanic drifts through the chaos of it all.
___

## Biology

The Oceanic is a variant of the Slugcat species, being one of *many*. What sets the Oceanic apart is its ability to thrive both on land and in the oceans indefinitely. Its biology is unique from other slugcats, and this versatility across two completely different biomes gives it an advantage not many other slugcats possess.

### Habitat

The Oceanic resides in the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and the vast lands above. Although built for the seas, it ventures onto land frequently, primarily because the land provides more diverse types of food.

### Appearance

Its skin is colored in a gradient of teals and deep navies, tapering into a pale cream underside. Spots of bioluminescence are scattered along its back down to its tail. Its four eyes grant excellent vision in both darkness and water, and its gills, located on the sides of the head, are deep lavender and can sometimes shift to a pink or blue depending on the situation. 

Webbed paws and a tail with fin-like webbing on both sides provide lift and agility in swimming. On each paw, a venomous spur resides just below the lower joint where the fingers connect to the paw. This spur delivers a potent hallucinogenic toxin capable of incapacitating attackers when administered. On the base of each finger lies a grip pad, mainly designed for traction on slippery surfaces in or around water, but is also greatly utilized on normal land.

Below is a diagram displaying the anatomy of the Oceanic’s left paw:

### Diet

The Oceanic is omnivorous. In the ocean, it feeds on small fish, underwater plant life, and occasionally larger aquatic creatures. Since food can be sparse and hunting can be dangerous in deep waters, it often forages on land. Here, its diet includes fruit, popcorn plant, batflies, and basically anything it can catch, kill, or gather.

### Reproduction

The Oceanic reproduces asexually via budding. When it starts the process, a bud forms on the top side of the tail. In ~1–2 cycles, the bud detaches and rapidly begins to internally separate, developing a juvenile inside. The egg has faint bioluminescence under the blue outer membrane, helping the parent locate it and signaling that it is still healthy.

This bioluminescence also plays a role in genetic diversity. During the formation, ATP hydrolysis reactions can sometimes leak water into the DNA of the developing egg, causing subtle but stable mutations in the process. That very same DNA is copied across all cells, leading to that mutation to stick. Within ~2–3 cycles, the Oceanic slugpup emerges.

After hatching, the parent promptly leaves the slugpup to mature independently. For the first few cycles, the slugpup consumes microscopic plankton and algae while keeping far away from danger. Once plankton and algae are no longer sufficient, the juvenile learns to hunt and forage for more substantial food. The parent continues its life with little to no contact with its offspring until ascension. Usually the Oceanic only produces 1 or 2 pups per lifespan.

### Behavior

The Oceanic is not a very social creature, especially compared to other slugcats. This is likely due to the lack of parental care, which reduces the need for social interaction. Highly independent like most slugcats, it prefers to hunt and scavenge alone.

When hunting, hiding, or in a hostile location, the Oceanic minimizes the use of its bioluminescence to avoid unwanted attention. On land, it will attempt to neutralize threats through conventional means, such as a spear or piece of rebar. If that fails, or if it is underwater, it relies on its venomous spurs to incapacitate the foe. Depending on hunger levels, it may inject the predator with more toxin and consume it, or leave it alive with only a survivable amount of venom and flee.

>Even the survivable dose of venom still induces intense and vivid hallucinations for a few minutes in the recipient.

## Physiology

### Egg Propagation

When undergoing reproduction, the Oceanic releases the hormone **Noetrophin-a1** throughout the body, which eventually binds to the **Luminal Morphogenetic c2 Receptor a1 (LMc2Ra1)** receptors in the budding organ within its tail. Activation of **LMc2Ra1** starts a morphogenetic signaling cascade, stimulating DNA replication, cytoplasmic reorganization, and controlled cellular differentiation within the forming bud. Once the genetic nucleus is established, it's enclosed in a protective membrane. Rapid cell division then begins, shaping the egg. Finally, specialized bioluminescent photocyte precursors are activate, leading to a faint bioluminescent glow.

As mentioned in the **reproduction** section, the bioluminescence helps maintain genetic diversity. During the formation of the photocyte precursors, ATP hydrolysis slightly elevates the local concentration of reactive water molecules, increasing the likelihood of **hydrolytic DNA damage** in the developing genetic core. These events produce small, stable mutations in genes controlling morphology, pigmentation, and body proportions, contributing to genetic diversity.

```text
Phototropin-a1 --> Budding organ activated --> ATP Hydrolysis --> Bioluminescence
                                               ↳ Hydrolytic DNA Damage
                             + Replication Errors --> ↳ Possible Stable Mutations
```

Mutations also occur naturally during cell replication, when occasional DNA polymerase errors escape repair. The combination of **environmental hydrolysis** and **intrinsic replication variance** ensures that each slugpup exhibits subtle yet stable genetic differences, maintaining the Oceanic’s adaptive variability across generations.

### Bioluminescence

The Oceanic’s bioluminescence is produced by a light emitting molecule called **Mariluciferin**, which is activated by the enzyme **Cerulophotoxidase**.

```text
Mariluciferin + O2 --[Cerulophotoxidase + Ca2]--> Light + Oxidized Mariluciferin
Oxidized Mariluciferin + ATP --[Mariphotoreductase]--> Mariluciferin
```

When the Oceanic sends oxygen to **Cerulophotoxidase**, **Mariluciferin** oxidizes, producing a soft teal and navy glow. Specialized photocyte cells produce **Mariphotoreductase**, rapidly restoring **oxidized Mariluciferin** to its active form, allowing perpetual illumination without depleting chemical reserves.

### Venom Biochemistry

The Oceanic delivers a potent venom, **Thalasocyanin**, via a hollow spur on each paw. Thalasocyanin is a **trimeric complex** consisting of a small lipophilic alkaloid (**Cyanoliphin**), a disulfide-rich neuropeptide (**Duracyanethrin**), and an enzymatic carrier protein (**Thalase-c1**). The complex is stored in subdermal granules and released by muscular pressure on the spur.

```text
(50% dose)

Venom Injected
       ↓
Cyanoliphin [small lipophilic alkaloid] → Central perceptual disruption (hallucinations)
Duracyanethrin [disulfide-rich peptide] → Local neuromuscular block + vasodilation
       ↓
Metabolism & clearance
```

**Onset and dose:** Cyanoliphin is a small (~200–500 Da), highly lipophilic tertiary amine that easily crosses the blood brain barrier. At high local doses and in small animals it can cause perceptual distortion within seconds, while in larger animals onset may require tens of seconds to minutes depending on vascular uptake. Duracyanethrin produces local flaccid paralysis within seconds at the site of injection and can progress to systemic paralysis over tens of seconds to minutes depending on total dose and target size.

#### Composition

```text
Thalasocyanin = {Cyanoliphin + Duracyanethrin + Thalase-c1}
```

As stated above, **Thalasocyanin** is not a single compound. It consists of **three** primary components:

1. **Cyanoliphin:** a tryptamine-like compound that mainly acts as an agonist at **serotonin (5-HT2A)** receptors, producing vivid hallucinations, and lightly acts as an antagonist at **NMDA** receptors, contributing to perceptual disorientation and altered sensory processing.

2. **Duracyanethrin:** a small, disulfide-stabilized peptide that blocks **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors** at the muscles, stopping nerve signals and causing quick paralysis. It also It induces vasodilation via endothelial **nitric oxide (NO)** release, relaxing vessel walls, and slightly triggers histamine release which enhances systemic venom distribution.

3. **Thalase-c1:** a calcium-binding enzyme-carrier protein that stabilizes Cyanoliphin and Duracyanethrin in the body and in water, while reducing local immune responses long enough for the venom to act.

**Delivery mechanics:** the venom is stored in subdermal granules at acidic pH. Pressure on the spur forces granule contents through the spur duct. The change in pH and salt balance activate **Thalase-c1**, exposing the active sites of Cyanoliphin and Duracyanethrin. **Thalase-c1** also reduces neutrophil recruitment and binds complement proteins, slowing mass immune detection and local inflammation so the venom stays active long enough to work.

**Duration & clearance:** At typical environmental temperatures, the venom’s effects last several minutes (**2–10 min**). **Thalase-c1** then promotes enzymatic breakdown while the body metabolizes the compounds. Outside the body, **Cyanoliphin** is unstable in air, losing potency within seconds to minutes. In water, however, the hydrophobic **Cyanoliphin** is encapsulated by **Thalase-c1**, which protects it from hydrolysis and oxidation, allowing the venom to remain active for up to **4-8 minutes**.

#### Biochemical Construction

**Thalasocyanin** is biosynthesized in the Oceanic’s paired venom glands as three parallel components: the lipophilic alkaloid **Cyanoliphin**, the disulfide-rich peptide **Duracyanethrin**, and the calcium-binding carrier protein **Thalase-c1**. Cyanoliphin is derived from tryptophan through sequential decarboxylation, hydroxylation, methylation, and lipid conjugation, producing a small CNS-active molecule. Duracyanethrin is synthesized as a ribosomal prepropeptide, folded and stabilized by disulfide bonds and post-translational modifications. Thalase-c1 folds into a hydrophobic pocket that binds Cyanoliphin and coordinates Duracyanethrin, forming an inactive pro-complex.

The components are packaged into acidic granules, where Thalase-c1 stabilizes them and shields the complex from immune detection. Upon spur activation, pH and ionic shifts trigger Thalase-c1 conformational opening and proteolytic cleavage of Duracyanethrin proregions, releasing the active toxin into tissue and blood. The venom is enzymatically cleared within minutes, while Cyanoliphin remains transiently active in aqueous environments due to hydrophobic encapsulation.

> NOTE: This has probably been the HARDEST part of this document. So much so, that I'm writing a not here to tell people how hard I worked on this one! The goal of this was to try and be able to estimate the construction of the molecules that make up the venom protein, and succeeded! I'll probably do this for bioluminescence, but NOT today or anytime soon because WOW this was a lot of research on a lot of things for a LOT of time. Thanks for reading!

### Respiration

The Oceanic’s respiratory system consists of two pairs of **gill filaments** and **internal lungs**, which switch priority depending on the environment.

When underwater, the Oceanic uses its gills. They are covered in small blood vessels, which when submerged, extract oxygen from the water and dispose of carbon dioxide. Their structure is similar to that of its sister species (The Rivulet), but the Oceanic’s gills are far more efficient, allowing it to stay submerged indefinitely.

On land, the internal lungs are used instead of the gills. These lungs draw in air, extracting the oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide and other byproducts. The lungs extract oxygen efficiently, allowing the Oceanic to spend time on land indefinitely. The lungs can also be used as a swim bladder, inflating and deflating with oxygen to float or sink. This is also what's used to keep the Oceanic neutrally buoyant when underwater.

Below is a diagram displaying the air extraction between the gills and the lungs:
```text
Water --> Gills --[O2]--> Blood --> Body
Air --> Lungs --[O2]--> Blood --> Body

Lungs Underwater:
Gills --[O2]--> Lungs inflate
```
	
This diagram is somewhat useless, but I feel like I had to put *something* there.

### Visual System

The Oceanic has a **tetrad of eyes**: an upper pair, of compressed ovals and a lower pair of shorter, more compressed ovals. This difference in shape and placement is for specialization in two different environments. Each set contains a special lens that can slightly shift forwards or backwards to help maintain focus across differing refractive indices between air and water.

**Upper eyes:** Optimized for visualization in air and above the waterline. Their taller, less compressed lenses allow for better focusing across variable refractive indices and improved vertical perception. Although adapted for land, it's still used underwater in tandem with the lower pair, reducing blind spots and allowing for better vision in more complicated terrain.

**Lower eyes:** Specialized in underwater vision. The slightly more flattened shape increases horizontal field and reduces spherical aberration in water allowing for a clearer picture and improved edge detection. These eyes have a denser rod population to improve light sensitivity in dim, blue-shifted light. While still functional on land, their primary role is to help the upper pair by filling peripheral blind zones and allowing better vision in low light environments.

#### Neural Integration and Switching
The brain integrates input from all four eyes into a composite visual map. Priority shifts depending on environment (water or land). When submerged, the lower pair dominates contrast and edge detection. On land, the upper pair leads in focus and detail. This switching is fast and mostly subconscious, only causing brief blurriness during adjustment.

Below is a visual representation of the eye arrangement:

Usually they are more wavy, but this would be *very* hard to achieve in ASCII art, so this will do for now.

## Personality

>NOTE: May change!!!

Being a very solitary creature, the Oceanic doesn’t understand companionship. Surviving alone and learning by themselves all their life left them wandering constantly, physically and mentally. But beneath that confusion, they want to know what it’s like. What it’s like to have help, to not be seen as food or dangerous, **to be understood**. They don’t like that desire; they’re too scared to act on it, but they can’t suppress it either.

Fearing the unknown in a world filled with unknowns is exhausting. A need to *know* what everything is and *how* it runs. The unfamiliar and non-constant are deeply terrifying things... The Oceanic trusts patterns more then instinct, mind more then gut. In their view, everything is temporary. From shelter and safety, to even light and food, Nothing lasts forever. They don't rush unless necessary. They don't act without thinking. To them, hesitation means death.

Curiosity covers over the deep void left by their solitude. Thinking and learning is what keeps them from needing anything else, or *anyone* else. They run, hide, and suppress their deeper emotions, because to them it's just noise. Patterns are quiet, logical, safe. Emotions can be sporadic, **loud**, and apart of something greater. But sometimes, something breaks through: a weed in the clearing... a feeling too strong to ignore, and they're deeply terrified of it. Usually they try to analyze it, fit it into something that can be named. But feelings can't be grasped like they'd want.

To them, the world is like water, always shifting, never the same twice. Nothing lasts, not light, not the calm, not even the things they love. Because of this view, they've stopped loving anything too deeply, since It was easier that way. They keep everything they cant understand buried so deep, that to them, they don't even exist. But it scratch's, it claws, it **yearns** to be free. A cloud can only hold so much water before it starts to fall...

The Oceanic's world is exhausting to them, never a pause in the downpour of thoughts. But not thinking hurts to much to bare. Even in safety and peace, the drip never stops, the thoughts of how things work... what would the name of this be... what's this thing... what's that thing... *what would it feel like to not be **alone***.

## Story

### Worldbuilding

#### Timeline Context

The story of the Oceanic begins **between the Rivulet and Saint campaigns**, during a period when unusually heavy rainfall caused the formation of a vast ocean. Around this time, **Five Pebbles** and **the Rot** were at peak activity, producing more water than could be cycled back into the superstructure. Additional failures in nearby iterators, including those near the retaining wall of LTTM and FP, caused water to accumulate in previously dry areas, contributing to the formation of **The Basin**.

#### The Basin

Geologically, **the Basin** is classified as a lake. However, because of its immense size and biodiversity (in certain areas), it's essentially an ocean. The Basin's fauna and flora is comprised but not limited to: kelp, algae, coral, multiple species of small and medium fish, stingrays, sharks, and much more. However, the biodiversity of this region is densely clustered in patches and sparse in most other places.

However, the biodiversity of this region is densely clustered in patches and sparse in most other places. For instance, the **Abyss**, where light cannot reach, remains mostly barren. The Abyss has the major benefit of being safe from the rain, as it cannot pierce deep enough to reach it. However, the lack of light severely limits the fauna and flora in this region, which makes up most of the Basin. 

Of course, life always finds a way. At the depths of the Basin, where the earth fissures and cracks, some creatures are said to have learned to survive off the void fluid, in a similar way the ancients once did. But that’s just a myth, and likely not true.

The main biome with the most biodiversity are the **Shelfs**, which are scattered all throughout the Basin. The Shelfs sit at the hit depth for rainfall impact, so most life hides beneath rock formations, overhangs, or other geological structures that can shield anything below.

- **Abyss:** A deep region where sunlight cannot penetrate. Sparse life survives here, but it is shielded from rainfall, providing safety from environmental disturbances.

- **Shelfs:** Scattered throughout the Basin, these shallow, rocky regions are the richest in biodiversity. They provide shelter and resources for aquatic life, protecting them from rainfall and predators.

#### Oceanic Emergence

The Oceanic starts some time after these events, when FP has collapsed and the rain is near normal amounts (Survivor Timeline). ASCII timeline is provided bellow, because why not.

*Most* of the iterator super structures that could be accessed from the Basin within a reasonable amount of time are all collapsed by now. There is one superstructure that lasted, but I'll keep their name hidden for now.

### Slugpup

Since the Oceanic reproduces asexually, it has no memory of their parent in any way, shape, or form. In fact, it may not even be aware that it has a parent.

I *could* write a very descriptive timeline on how much plankton and algae they ate, but I feel like that wouldn't be interesting. Instead, I'm just going to say that they ate enough plankton and algae (like any good slugpup should) and didn't die.

"They ate enough plankton and algae and didn't die."

Okay, now onto its adolescence, where the story actually starts.

### Part 1 -- Lost

The Oceanic wandered into what seemed to be a ruin of some kind. Filled with too many pipes and directions, they found themselves lost, resurfacing in an air pocket to think. The air filled with particles they didn't want to know the constitution of. Their ears twitch as they look at the small ripples on the water's surface illuminated by their faint glow. They dip back down and look at the options they have. Choosing a random pipe and hoping for the best. The faint glow their spots are giving off helping them see in the dark waters.

After what seemed like an endless maze of pipes, they see a faint beam of light coming from a crack in the wall. They go into another pipe, which this time leads to a hallway with small cracks in the roof letting more sunlight beam in. Oceanic keeps swimming, eventually leading to a pipe that brings them to a more cramped hallway with more light shimmering through. After entering the pipe at the end of this hallway, they are spat out into a vast coral reef like none they have seen before.

Fish swim by, below and above. The Oceanic looks around for a shelter since the rain is nearing and this place is far too shallow to survive out in the open. They start swimming right... no time for sight seeing. While passing by and grabbing a fish, they notice a shelter hidden behind a large growth of kelp. They swiftly eat the fish and make their way to the shelter and get in. The loud sounds of the water draining from the shelter fill the small area. Oceanic sits down as they faintly hear the rain stir up the water. The Oceanic realizes that they have no idea where they are or how to get back.

Water rushes into the shelter as the door begins to open, slamming Oceanic into the wall of the shelter until the pressure is finally even. They shake it off and swim out of the shelter, now getting a good look at the coral reef they are in. The coral is growing under large rock formations to protect themselves from the rain. There are families of fish and stingrays swimming and floating around. It's much more alive than where Oceanic is used to.

They look up at the faint surface above. They swim up to try and look at where in the Basin they are located. Just as they are about to pass the cliffs circling the reef, a giant creature swims by in a flash, pushing Oceanic back. It was too fast too see what it was... they look around, trying to find it but to no avail. They try to swim up again but it rushes by once more. This time they were ready, and stabbed it with the spur on its right paw. The creature immediately stops and then starts swimming sporadically in circles.

They finally get a good look at it. It looks like a stingray, but with a strange dorsal fin on the top and bottom. They decide to leave it be and swim to the surface. Popping their head above and shaking the water off their face, they see endless ocean as far as they can see. They are a bit confused how a small journey to look at a ruin they passed by somehow led them in the middle of the Basin. They plunge back down below to look at their surroundings. They decide to swim back down and try to go back into the pipe they came from. As they approach the location, they see it's an empty cliff face... Like there was nothing there to begin with.

They go right, trying to get behind the cliff. After a bit of swimming they find a cave opening along the cliff wall, and decide to go in. They keep swimming through the dark cave, which was faintly lit up by their spots. At the very end of this long cave is a single shelter and a patch of mushrooms. They know these mushrooms are safe to eat, so at least they have food for this cycle. They gobble up the mushrooms and enter the shelter, prompting it to loudly drain the water kept within. They swear it gets louder every time...

### Part 2 -- A growth in the clearing

Water rushes in, awakening Oceanic from a deeper sleep than usual. Fully awakened when they're slammed to the wall from the pressure. Swimming out of the shelter, they almost forgot that they where in a cave, expecting a view of the coral. Swimming through the tight cavern for what seemed like to long, they eventually reached the open water. Deciding to swim above the cliff, they see it spans quite far, further then they expected. Swimming across they watch as groups of fish race underneath them. Quite a while goes by of swimming across rocky surface with little plant life living on it. After a while, they start to get a better look at the edge... it's just sand. Whiter then usual, but sand nonetheless.

After a bit, they reach the edge. Swimming down and look at the cliff behind them, it's just a smoothed slope with coral growing near the bottom. They turn around, looking around the new area. Sand... all just sand... as far as they could see. Not a single rock, cliff, plant, or even fish in sight. Only the vast cliff behind them and an empty flat of cratered sand shaped by the rainfall. They swim into the clearing hesitantly, almost not wanting to. It's to empty, to clear. They stop and swim a bit lower, grabbing a pawful of the sand, staring at it. Why would there be a giant patch of this... with nothing in it?

Swimming again, they see something in the distance, to far to get a proper look at it. Swimming faster out of curiosity, it starts to come into picture. A pillar of some unknown material stuck into the sand. Getting closer they see it has markings on it, markings they recognize but don't understand. Stopping in front of it, they see it's about double their size, 3 markings on each of its 4 sides. 

After a moment, they recognize them: the symbols the ancients used that they see everywhere on the surface. Carefully laying a paw on it. It's a cold surface, probably made out of a stone of some kind. Why would there be a pillar out *here*?

Circling around it, there's nothing special to it. It's just a pillar with markings on it stuck in the sand. They dig underneath the pillar, to see if this that's actually it. As they dig, they feel something weird underneath the sand: A black... flesh?They jump back in surprise, their spots flashing a bit as they do. 

After calming down from the scare, they give it a poke... nothing. They give it another more firm poke... nothing. Whatever it is, it seems to be dead. They start to dig out more around it, hoping to to identify it. After some time, a substantial amount around it has been dug up. It seems to be made up of fleshly bulbs or... growths all stuck together, black in color. A tendril connected to it seems to span further into the sand, and to deep for them to dig it out in a reasonable amount of time.

It doesn't look like it's from the Basin... how would something from the land get out here... underneath a pillar... in the middle of nowhere?

They swim up to the surface, popping their head above the waters surface, looking around. Still no land to be seen... wait, no... there's a line on the horizon... Land! But what side? The similar or unknown? They dip back down, looking down at the partially dug out creature next to the pillar, and the vast emptiness. After a moment, they decide to travel to the land. Swimming towards the direction of the landmass.

Some time passes of just swimming... a worry crosses their mind: *What if the rain comes before I find a shelter..?*. They brush the thought aside, and keep swimming, a bit faster now. Swimming quietly for a bit, they are left to think about what they found this cycle. Where am I... what is the pillar for... what could that creature be? It couldn't be a fish... it doesn't look like a lizard or a vulture... I swear I've seen something like it before, I had to... but where... *where did I see something like that*...

They're brought out of their thoughts, as they notice the sky start to darken, and clouds covering the sky. As the first drops of rain shoot into the water around them, they spot something... a small cliff with coral underneath it... a possible, if they're lucky, a shelter! They swim as fast as they can... *I'm not going to make it*... they feel the water starting to push them around... *I'm not going to make it*... lifted sand starts to block their vision... *I'm not going to make it*.

Suddenly, through the sand impairing their vision, they see a pipe in the middle of the sand. Stopping quickly and taking a glace, it's a shelter pipe! A drop of water shoots beside them, almost slamming into Oceanic. They race into it, as a spear of rain almost hits them again. They drop down and float down onto the floor, letting out a BIG sigh of relief. They thought they where dead for sure! Water draining from the shelter loudly, they lay their head down, staring at the shelters bland roof, still full of adrenaline. As the high wears off, their left to think as they dose off... **Food**.
