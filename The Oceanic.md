# The Oceanic
An Aquatic slugcat built for survivability and the depths below.

___

## Overview
The Oceanic is a subspecies of the Slugcat, adapted for the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and the vast land above. Fast and nimble, it cuts through the sunlit waters. Where life crawls and spires fall, the Oceanic drifts through the ruins of it all.
___

## Biology

The Oceanic is part of the Slugcat genus, being one of its *many* variants. What sets the Oceanic apart is its ability to thrive both on land and in the oceans indefinitely. Its biology is unique from other slugcats, and this versatility across two completely different biomes gives it an advantage not much else possesses.

### Habitat

The Oceanic resides in the deep oceans beyond the retaining wall and in the vast lands above. Although built for the seas, it ventures onto land frequently, primarily because the land provides more diverse types of food.

### Appearance

Its skin is colored in a gradient of teals and deep navies, tapering into a pale cream underside. Spots of bioluminescence are scattered along its back down to its tail. Its four eyes grant excellent vision in both darkness and water, and its gills, located on the sides of the head, are deep lavender and can sometimes shift to a pink or blue depending on the situation. 

Webbed paws and a tail with fin-like webbing on both sides provide lift and agility in swimming. On each paw, a venomous spur resides just below the lower joint where the fingers connect to the hand. This spur delivers a potent hallucinogenic toxin capable of incapacitating attackers when administered. On the base of each finger lies a grip pad, mainly designed for traction on slippery surfaces in or around water, but is also greatly utilized on normal land.

Below is a diagram displaying the anatomy of the Oceanic’s left paw:

### Diet

The Oceanic is omnivorous. In the ocean, it feeds on small fish, underwater plant life, and occasionally larger aquatic creatures. Since food can be sparse and hunting dangerous in deep waters, it often forages on land, where its diet includes fruit, popcorn plant, batflies, and basically anything it can catch, kill, or gather.

### Reproduction

The Oceanic reproduces asexually via budding. When it starts the process, a bud forms on the top side of the tail. In ~1–2 cycles, the bud detaches and rapidly begins to internally separate, developing a juvenile inside. The egg has faint bioluminescence under the blue outer membrane, helping the parent locate it and signaling that it is still healthy. Within ~2–3 cycles, the Oceanic slugpup emerges.

After hatching, the parent promptly leaves the slugpup to mature independently. For the first few cycles, the slugpup consumes microscopic plankton and algae while keeping far away from danger. Once plankton and algae are no longer sufficient, the juvenile learns to hunt and forage for more substantial food. The parent continues its life with little to no contact with its offspring until ascension.

### Behavior

The Oceanic is not a very social creature, especially compared to other slugcats. This is likely due to the lack of parental care, which reduces the need for social interaction. Highly independent like most slugcats, they prefer to hunt and scavenge alone.

When hunting, hiding, or in a hostile location, the Oceanic minimizes the use of its bioluminescence to avoid unwanted attention. On land, it will attempt to neutralize threats through conventional means, such as a spear or piece of rebar. If that fails, or if it is underwater, it relies on its venomous spurs to incapacitate the foe. Depending on hunger levels, it may inject the predator with more toxin and consume it, or leave it alive with only a survivable amount of venom and flee.

>Even the survivable dose of venom still induces intense and vivid hallucinations for a few minutes in the recipient.

## Physiology

### Bioluminescence

The Oceanic’s bioluminescence is produced by a light emitting molecule called **Mariluciferin**, which is activated by the enzyme **Cerulophotoxidase**.

```text
Mariluciferin + O2 --[Cerulophotoxidase + Ca2]--> Light + Oxidized Mariluciferin
Oxidized Mariluciferin + ATP --[Mariphotoreductase]--> Mariluciferin
```

When the Oceanic sends oxygen to **Cerulophotoxidase**, **Mariluciferin** oxidizes, producing a soft teal and navy glow. Specialized photocyte cells produce **Mariphotoreductase**, rapidly restoring **oxidized Mariluciferin** to its active form, allowing perpetual illumination without depleting chemical reserves.

### Venom Spur

The Oceanic can also deliver a strong venom called **Thalasocyanin** through a spur located on each paw. **Thalasocyanin** consists of a small lipophilic molecule that triggers extremely vivid hallucinations and a disulfide rich neuropeptide that temporarily paralyzes muscles and dilates blood vessels. The venom is stored as protective granules in paired subdermal glands and released via muscle contractions during pressure on the spur.

Below is a diagram displaying the order **Thalasocyanin** takes:
```text
Venom Injected
       ↓
Lipophilic compound > Hallucinations
Neuropeptide > Paralysis & Vasodilation
       ↓
Metabolism & clearance
```

Upon injection, the two compounds begin acting almost immediately. The lipophilic compound induces hallucinations within the first second. After roughly five seconds, muscle paralysis begins in the injected limb, progressing to full-body paralysis in around eight seconds.

### Respiration

The Oceanic’s respiratory system consists of two pairs of **gill filaments** and **internal lungs**, which switch priority depending on the environment.

When underwater, the Oceanic uses its gills. They are covered in small blood vessels, which when submerged, extract oxygen from the water and dispose of carbon dioxide. Their structure is similar to that of its sister species (The Rivulet), but the Oceanic’s gills are far more efficient, allowing it to stay submerged indefinitely.

On land, the internal lungs are used instead of the gills. These lungs draw in air, extracting the oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide and other byproducts. The lungs extract oxygen efficiently, allowing the Oceanic to spend time on land indefinitely. The lungs can also be used as a swim bladder, inflating and deflating with oxygen to float or sink. This is also what's used to keep the Oceanic neutrally buoyant when underwater.

Below is a diagram displaying the air extraction between the gills and the lungs:
```text
Water --> Gills --[O2]--> Blood --> Body
Air --> Lungs --[O2]--> Blood --> Body

Lungs Underwater:
Gills --[O2]--> Lungs inflate
```
	
This diagram is somewhat useless, but I feel like I had to put *something* there.

### Visual System

The Oceanic has a **tetrad of eyes**: an upper pair, of compressed ovals and a lower pair of shorter, more compressed ovals. This difference in shape and placement is for specialization in two environments. Each set contains a special lens that can slightly shift forwards or backwards to help maintain focus across differing refractive indices between air and water.

**Upper eyes:** Optimized for visualization in air and from above the waterline. Their taller, less compressed lenses allow for better focusing across variable refractive indices and improved vertical perception. Although adapted for land, it's still used underwater in tandem with the lower pair, reducing blind spots and allowing for better vision in more complicated terrain.

**Lower eyes:** Specialized in underwater vision. The slightly more flattened shape increases horizontal field and reduces spherical aberration in water allowing for a clearer picture and improving edge detection. These eyes have a denser rod population to improve light sensitivity in dim, blue-shifted light. While still functional on land, their primary role there is to help the upper pair by filling peripheral blind zones and giving better vision low light environments.

**Neural integration and switching:** The brain integrates input from all four eyes into a composite visual map. Priority shifts depending on environment (water or land). When submerged, the lower pair dominates contrast and edge detection. On land, the upper pair leads in focus and detail. This switching is fast and mostly subconscious, only causing brief blurriness during adjustment.

Below is a visual representation of the eye arrangement:

Usually they are more wavy, but this would be *very* hard to achieve in ASCII art, so this will do for now.

## Story
> NOTE: The lore section is VERY unfinished, so things may be subject to completely being changed. Thanks!

### Pre-Campaign: Timeline

The Oceanic’s story begins between the **Rivulet** and **Saint** campaigns, where the rain has caused a vast ocean to form. Around this time, Five Pebbles and the Rot are at their peak output which produced *vast* amounts of water, more than could be cycled back into the superstructure. Other factors also caused more water to collect away from iterators. For example: other iterators that were near the retaining wall of LTTM and FP started failing. These events caused the creation of **The Basin**.

**The Basin** is geologically classified as a "lake" but because of it's immense size and biodiversity (in certain areas), it's essentially an ocean. The Basin's fauna and flora is comprised but not limited to: kelp, algae, coral, multiple species of small and medium fish, stingrays, sharks, and much more. However, the biodiversity of this region is densely clustered in patches and sparse in most other places. 

For instance, the **Abyss**, where light cannot reach, remains mostly barren. The Abyss has the major benefit of being safe from the rain, as it cannot pierce deep enough to reach it. However, the lack of light severely limits the fauna and flora in this region, which makes up most of the Basin. 

But, of course, life always finds a way. At the depths of the Basin, where the earth fissures and cracks, some creatures are said to have learned to survive off the void fluid, in a similar way the ancients once did. But that’s just a myth, and not true.

The main biome with the most biodiversity is the **Shelfs**, which are scattered all throughout the Basin. The Shelfs sit at the hit depth for rainfall impact, so most life hides beneath rock formations, overhangs, or other geological structures that can shield anything below.

The Oceanic starts some time after these events, when FP has collapsed and the rain is near normal amounts (Survivor Timeline).

ASCII timeline because I can:
```text

     +--------------+------------+----------+---------------+--------------+-----------+----------+
     
PS: This looks very bad when not in a markdown viewer!
```

*Most* of the iterator super structures that could be accessed from the Basin within a reasonable amount of time are all collapsed. There is one superstructure that lasted, but I'll keep their name hidden for now.

### Pre-Campaign: Slugpup

Since the Oceanic reproduces asexually, they have no memory of their parent in any way, shape, or form. In fact, they may not even be aware that they have a parent.

I *could* write a very descriptive timeline on how much plankton and algae they ate, but I feel like that wouldn't be interesting. Instead, I'm just going to say that they ate enough plankton and algae (like any good slugpup should) and didn't die.

"They ate enough plankton and algae and didn't die."

Okay, now onto their adolescence, where the campaign actually starts.

### The Campaign: Part 1

The Oceanic found itself lost in what seemed to be a ruin of some kind. Filled with too many pipes and directions, they found themselves lost, resurfacing in an air pocket to think. The air filled with particles they didn't want to know the contents of. Their ears twitch, as they look at the small ripples on the water's surface illuminated by their faint glow. They dip back down and look at the options they have. Choosing a random pipe and hoping for the best. The faint glow their spots are giving off helping them see in the dark waters.

After what seemed like endless pipes, they see a faint beam of light from a crack in the wall. They go into another pipe, which this time leads to a hallway with small cracks in the roof letting sunlight beam in. Oceanic keeps swimming, eventually leading to a pipe that brings them to a more cramped hallway with more light shimmering through. After entering the pipe at the end of this hallway, they are spat out into a vast coral reef, like none they have seen before.

Fish swim by, below and above. The Oceanic looks around for a shelter since the rain is nearing and this place is far too shallow to survive out in the open. They start swimming right... no time for sight seeing. While passing by and grabbing a fish, they notice a shelter hidden behind a large growth of kelp. They swiftly eat the fish and make their way to the shelter and get in. The loud sounds of the water draining from the shelter fill the small area. Oceanic sits down as they faintly hear the rain stir up the water. The Oceanic realizes that they have no idea where they are or how to get back.

The shelter starts to open as water rushes into the shelter, slamming Oceanic into the wall of the shelter until the pressure is finally even. They shake it off and swim out of the shelter, now getting a good look at the coral reef they are in. The coral growing under large rock formations to protect itself from the rain. Families of fish and stingrays swimming and floating. It's much more alive than where Oceanic is used to.

They look up at the faint surface above. They swim up to try and look at where in the Basin they are located. Just as they are about to pass the cliffs circling the reef, a giant creature flashes, pushing Oceanic back. It was to fast too see what it was... they look around, trying to find it but to no avail. They try to swim up again but it rushes by again. This time they were ready, and stabbed it with the spur on its right paw. The creature immediately stops and starts swimming sporadically in circles.

They finally get a good look at it. It looks like a stingray, but with a strange dorsal fin on the top and bottom. They decide to leave it be and swim to the surface. Popping their head above and shaking the water off their face, they see endless ocean as far as they can see. They are a bit confused how a small journey to look at a ruin they passed by somehow led them in the middle of the Basin. They plunge back down below to look at their surroundings. They decide to swim back down and try to go back into the pipe they came from. As they approach the location, they see it's an empty cliff face... Like there was nothing there to begin with.

They go right, trying to get behind the cliff. After a bit of swimming they find a cave opening along the cliff wall, and decide to go in. They keep swimming through the dark cave, which was faintly lit up by their spots. At the very end of this long cave is a single shelter and a patch of mushrooms. These mushrooms they know are safe to eat, so at least they have food for this cycle. They gobble up the mushrooms and enter the shelter, as it loudly drains. They swear it gets louder every time...

### The Campaign: Part 2
Sometime soon idk. I got plannnsssssss!
